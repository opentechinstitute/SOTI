								Unlike measurements of the speed of light, ask two different groups to measure internet speeds in Baltimore, MD and you'll end up with two different answers. The reason is that unlike "the speed of the light," "the speed of the internet" isn't a precise phrase. Do you mean the speed at which your computer gets files from the internet? If you do, what kind of computer should be considered? Where in the world should the files be located? Any answer to one of those questions is an opinion about how to measure internet speed and reasonable, educated people have differing opinions.
							</p>
							<p>
								M-Lab provides one of the internet measurements we look at and <span><a href= "https://www.measurementlab.net/faq/#why-are-my-m-lab-results-different-from-other-speed-tests">their opinion is written here.</a></span> Another "measurement" of internet speed comes from <span><a href="https://www.fcc.gov/general/explanation-broadband-deployment-data">the FCC's Form 477 data.</a></span> This data isn't truly "measured." Instead, the FCC requires all internet providers that meet certain qualifications to report the locations they serve and, among other things, the maximum advertised speed served to those regions.
							</p>
							<p>
								But when you ask a salesperson a question, you get a salesperson's answer. Leaving aside whether the maximum advertised speed in a neighborhood (compared with the maximum purchased, median purchased or advertised, etc) is even the right number to consider, regulators exist because companies aren't taken at their word in situations where honesty isn't incentivized. When companies <i>are</i> taken at their word by the regulators, as in the case of the FCC's 477 data, researchers and journalists <span><a href = "https://www.citylab.com/life/2018/02/fcc-high-speed-broadband-internet-access-map/554516/" >watching the industry</a></span> see <span> <a href= "https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/24/17882842/us-internet-broadband-map-isp-fcc-wireless-competition">faults in the the data</a></span> the government accepts as true.
							</p>
							<p>
								Below is a map of the internet speed in the U.S. as measured by M-Lab, collected through the FCC's Form 477, and considered in their difference. You can explore internet speeds at the county level or, by zooming in, at the State House and State Senate levels.
							</p>
							<p>Scattered across the map are vignettes, some written by people affiliated with M-Lab, others by independent journalists and researchers, that taken with the data underneath them describe the state of the internet, with all its faults and areas for improvement, in the U.S. as it stands today.

										Long lists of analogies exist trying to explain internet speed. Internet speed can be a <span><a href="https://broadbandnow.com/guides/how-much-internet-speed-do-i-need">a pie to be sliced</a></span> or <span><a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/utilities/how-to-decide-what-internet-speed-you-need/">a hose spraying water</a></span> or <span><a href=">https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/1950065-word-of-the-week-bandwidth-explain-it-with-an-analogy"> a highway carrying cars</a></span>, depending on who's writing. But the kernel of each analogy is a tradeoff between this thing called "internet speed" that your service provider (ISP) gives you and the amount of that "internet speed" you need to act online.
									</p>
									
									<p>
										The amount you need depends on what activity you want to do and how many of the people you live with are also online. If you’re looking at 8 megabyte (Mb) large pictures a friend took on your 8 Mb per second (Mbps) internet connection, it’ll take one second for that picture to load. That’s a totally workable wait time. On the other hand,  4k video requires at least 16 Mbps, which means that for every second of video you watch, you have to wait for two, and that’s if you’re the only one at home on the internet. The amount of internet your ISP gives you gets split between every computer, phone, Playstation, and internet-enabled lightbulb. So the more devices active at one time, the more internet you need.
									</p>
									
									<p>
										Well, how much internet is that? <span><a href="https://www.fcc.gov/research-reports/guides/household-broadband-guide">The FCC has weighed on the question</a></span>, recommending 3-8 Mbps for one user browsing the internet and streaming HD video or two users just browsing. For three or more users to comfortably scroll around on the internet, two users to stream HD video, or one user to stream video on the TV and FaceTime on their phone, the FCC says customers need 12 to 25 Mbps . But if three or more users want to do multiple things, you’ll need at least 25 Mbps.
